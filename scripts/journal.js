You can do the same with bracket notation, but with different syntax: object['name']. Bracket notation can include variables and strings that start with numbers as long as they are written as a string within the brackets.",

    entry: "'Conjunction junction, what's your function'? For whatever reason, I think of this opening line to the school house rock song that explains the function of the grammar construct, conjunctions. And I think they are related in a very loose way. Conjunctions in English allow 'users' to string together thoughts without having to make a new sentence. While this can be verbose, 'and' and 'but' are kind of like functions you can call on in language to make your sentence a compound sentence. Functions allow you to execute a line of code whenever you need it. The contrast is that functions in JavaScript allow you to be less verbose. When the same lines of code need to be repeated, I can put them in a function instead of repeating myself.",
